# 🏝️ RAG with FAISS: Answering Queries about Alcatraz

This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline in Python.  
It ingests text files about **Alcatraz**, converts them into embeddings, stores them in a **FAISS vector database**, and answers user queries by
retrieving relevant context and generating responses.
